Hello, Lampo Group!  Thank you very much for taking the time to review my application and code samples.  I am submitting 3 different samples to you in hopes that I will demonstrate not only skill, but the ability to learn and learn quickly.  I understand that the Lampo Group is moving with purpose towards Ruby on Rails development.  I want to assure you that I am more than willing (dare I say, excited!) to become proficient in RoR as quickly as you need.  I was able to get my feet wet through Michael Hartl's great online tutorial, and I am looking forward to continuing down that path.

All of my recent and most worthy code has been developed at work.  Therefore, I have worked to extract all sensitive and private information, both for my employer and clients.  These code samples were taken from current, working programs and were developed by myself (with some input from my coworkers - we work closely on projects).  I have also attempted to comment my code thoroughly so that it's easy to follow.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.  Feel free to call or email using the contact information provided on the application.

Thanks again, and have a fantastic holiday!
Chris Wright
